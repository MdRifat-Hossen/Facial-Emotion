# Facial Expression Recognition: A Machine Learning Approach with SVM, Random Forest, KNN, and Decision Tree Using Grid Search

## ðŸ“„ **Overview**
This project explores facial expression recognition (FER) as a vital interface for bridging human emotions and machine understanding, with applications in healthcare, psychology, and human-computer interaction. It evaluates the performance of machine learning modelsâ€”**SVM**, **Random Forest**, **KNN**, and **Decision Tree**â€”on the CK+ dataset using **Grid Search** for hyperparameter optimization. The study highlights the superior performance of SVM for reliable and efficient FER systems.

## ðŸ“Š **Dataset**
- **Dataset Used:** CK+ (Cohn-Kanade Plus)
- **Description:** A benchmark dataset for FER research containing high-quality images of posed emotions.
- **Preprocessing Techniques:**
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Histogram equalization
- **Feature Extraction:** Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)
- **Data Split:** Cross-validation was performed using k-fold validation.

## ðŸ§  **Algorithms Used**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** Achieved the best performance with a linear kernel.
- **Random Forest:** Robust but slightly less accurate than SVM.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Performed well on smaller datasets.
- **Decision Tree:** Demonstrated lower accuracy, highlighting interpretability-performance trade-offs.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:** Grid Search was employed to identify the best parameter configurations for all models.

## ðŸ“Š **Results**
| Model          | Accuracy (%) | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | F1 Score (%) |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| SVM (Linear)   | 100         | 100           | 100        | 100         |
| Random Forest  | 97          | 98            | 97         | 97          |
| KNN            | 92          | 93            | 92         | 92          |
| Decision Tree  | 79          | 79            | 79         | 78          |

**SVM emerged as the most effective classifier, achieving 100% accuracy when using a linear kernel. Other models demonstrated competitive but slightly lower performances.**
